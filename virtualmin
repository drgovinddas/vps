** THESE STEPS ARE FOR ADDITIONAL VIRTUAL RAM CREATION, NOT COMPULSORY FOR VIRTUALMIN PROPER, BUT RECOMMENDED FOR SMALLER RAM INSTANCES**

**VIRTUALRAM CREATION OVER***

**TO AVOID ROOT LOGIN, CREATE NEW USER **

adduser newusername
usermod -aG sudo newusername
su - newusername
sudo ls -la /root   (ENTER PWD and check if it works, then start virtualmin under it. first command as root user back, second script with new user) 

*******webmin /virtualmin installation (you can rename instance to fqdn=subdomain like design, to auto-detect it, to avoid entering during unattended script************

sudo passwd root
apt update && apt -y upgrade && apt -y install curl wget sudo   (as root user)
wget https://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh && sudo /bin/sh install.sh -y    (as new user by su - newusername)
(prepare any test subdomain as fqdn to be given initially)
