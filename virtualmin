** THESE STEPS ARE FOR ADDITIONAL VIRTUAL RAM CREATION, NOT COMPULSORY FOR VIRTUALMIN PROPER, BUT RECOMMENDED FOR SMALLER RAM INSTANCES**
sudo su;
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=512M count=4;              
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile;
sudo mkswap /swapfile;
sudo swapon /swapfile;
sudo swapon -s

sudo nano /etc/fstab
//Add new line at the end of the file, ctrl O ctrl x, save the file, and then exit//

apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y;
reboot

**VIRTUALRAM CREATION OVER***

************/before installing any GUI panel, --PERMIT ROOT LOGIN (may not be required, if new superuser works)*************
**step 1-***
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
(1) If you want to set up “root” ec2 user password, find  “PermitRootLogin” parameter and change its value from “prohibit-password” to “yes“
(2) uncomment PasswordAuthentication yes         save ctrl O, exit ctrl X
service ssh restart 
**STEP 2-  sudo passwd root 

**TO AVOID ROOT LOGIN, CREATE NEW USER **

adduser newusername
usermod -aG sudo newusername
su - newusername
sudo ls -la /root   (ENTER PWD and check if it works, then start virtualmin under it. first command as root user back, second script with new user) 


*******webmin /virtualmin installation (you can rename instance to fqdn=subdomain like design, to auto-detect it, to avoid entering during unattended script************

apt update && apt -y upgrade && apt -y install curl wget sudo   (as root user)
wget https://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh && sudo /bin/sh install.sh -y    (as new user by su - newusername)
(prepare any test subdomain as fqdn to be given initially)
